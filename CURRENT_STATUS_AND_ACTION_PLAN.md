## 🔴 CURRENT BLOCKER: Manual Deployment Needed

### Problem
Render.com is not auto-deploying the enhanced API despite successful Git pushes.

### Evidence
- ✅ Git commits successful (1778303 pushed)
- ✅ Enhanced code ready in repository
- ❌ Live API still serves v1.0.0 (old version)
- ❌ Missing enhanced planetary data structure

### Root Cause
Render's auto-deployment is stuck or cached. Manual intervention required.
