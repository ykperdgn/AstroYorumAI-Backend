# Deployment Status Update - June 1, 2025

## 🚨 Current Issue: Render Deployment Not Updating

### Problem
- Local repository has flatlib integration (v2.0.0-flatlib)
- Git commits are successful and pushed to GitHub
- Render.com is still serving old deployment (v1.0.0)
- New endpoints (version-check) return 404
- Flatlib integration not active in production

### Attempted Solutions
1. ✅ Fixed requirements.txt (removed duplicate flatlib entries)
2. ✅ Updated version numbers in app.py
3. ✅ Fixed Procfile port binding
4. ✅ Multiple git commits and pushes
5. ✅ Added deployment trigger changes
6. ✅ Created version-check endpoint for verification

### Possible Causes
1. Render build cache issue
2. GitHub webhook not triggering properly
3. Build failure on Render (not visible to us)
4. Render free tier deployment delays
5. Configuration issue in Render dashboard

### Next Steps to Resolve
1. **Manual Render Dashboard Check**: Need to log into Render.com dashboard to:
   - Check deployment logs
   - Verify GitHub connection
   - Manually trigger deployment
   - Check for build errors

2. **Alternative Deployment**: If Render continues to have issues:
   - Deploy to Heroku as backup
   - Use Vercel for serverless deployment
   - Consider Railway.app

3. **Local Testing**: Verify flatlib works locally before redeploying

## 📊 Current Production Status
- ✅ **API Base URL**: https://astroyorumai-api.onrender.com
- ✅ **API Connectivity**: Working (basic endpoints)
- ❌ **Flatlib Integration**: Not deployed
- ❌ **Real Astrology Calculations**: Not available
- ✅ **Flutter App**: Ready for production backend

## 🎯 Immediate Actions Required
1. **Render Dashboard Investigation** (High Priority)
2. **Firebase Production Setup** (Can proceed in parallel)
3. **Local Flatlib Testing** (Verification)
4. **Beta Testing Preparation** (Once backend resolved)

## 🔄 Workaround for Beta Testing
If Render deployment continues to be problematic:
- Use enhanced mock data for initial beta testing
- Focus on UI/UX feedback from beta users
- Deploy real calculations after resolving infrastructure issues
