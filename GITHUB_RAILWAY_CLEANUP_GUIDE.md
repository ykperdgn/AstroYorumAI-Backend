1. Click on each Railway environment
2. Scroll down to **Environment settings**
3. Click **Delete Environment**
4. Confirm deletion

### Step 3: Check Deployments Section
1. Go to **Deployments** tab in your repository

   - `RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID`

### Step 6: Remove Railway Webhooks (if any)
1. Repository Settings → **Webhooks**
2. Look for any webhooks with Railway URLs
3. Delete Railway-related webhooks

## ✅ Verification

After cleanup, you should only see:
- ✅ Render.com deployments
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflows for Render

## 🎉 Final Status

Once completed:
- Railway completely removed from GitHub
- Only Render.com deployment visible
- Clean deployment history
- No Railway integrations remaining
