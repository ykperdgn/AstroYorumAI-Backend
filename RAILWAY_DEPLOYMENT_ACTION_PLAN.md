## üöÄ Step-by-Step Deployment Guide

### Step 1: Install Railway CLI
```powershell
# Install Railway CLI globally
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Verify installation
railway --version
```

### Step 2: Authenticate with Railway
```powershell
# Login to Railway (opens browser)
railway login

# Verify authentication
railway whoami
```

### Step 3: Create Railway Project
```powershell
# Navigate to project directory
cd c:\dev\AstroYorumAI

# Create new Railway project
railway new

# Follow prompts:
# - Project name: AstroYorumAI-Backend
# - Framework: Python
# - Deploy now: Yes
```
railway variables set FLASK_ENV=production
railway variables set PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
railway variables set API_VERSION=2.1.3-railway
railway variables set HOST=0.0.0.0
railway variables set PORT=8080
railway variables set CORS_ORIGINS="https://astroyorumai.com,https://www.astroyorumai.com"

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables
```powershell
# Core Flask configuration
railway variables set FLASK_ENV=production
railway variables set FLASK_DEBUG=False
railway variables set SECRET_KEY=railway-production-secret-key-2024

# Server configuration
railway variables set HOST=0.0.0.0
railway variables set PORT=8080
railway variables set WEB_CONCURRENCY=1
railway variables set PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

# API configuration
railway variables set API_VERSION=2.1.3-railway
railway variables set LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# CORS configuration
railway variables set CORS_ORIGINS="https://astroyorumai.com,https://www.astroyorumai.com"

# Keep-alive system (will be updated with actual Railway URL)
railway variables set ENABLE_KEEP_ALIVE=true
```

### Step 5: Add PostgreSQL Database
```powershell
# Add PostgreSQL service to Railway project
railway add postgresql

# This will automatically set DATABASE_URL environment variable
```

### Step 6: Deploy to Railway
```powershell
# Deploy current directory to Railway
railway up --detach

# Check deployment status
railway status

# View deployment logs
railway logs
```

### Step 7: Get Deployment URL
```powershell
# Get assigned Railway domain
railway domain

# Example output: astroyorumai-backend-production.up.railway.app
```

### Step 8: Update Keep-Alive URL
```powershell
# Update keep-alive URL with actual Railway domain
railway variables set KEEP_ALIVE_URL="https://[your-railway-domain].up.railway.app/health"
```

### Step 9: Verify Deployment
```powershell
# Test health endpoint
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://[your-railway-domain].up.railway.app/health" -Method GET | ConvertFrom-Json

# Expected response:
# {
#   "status": "healthy",
#   "version": "2.1.3-railway",
#   "service": "AstroYorumAI API",
#   "platform": "Railway.app",
#   "python_version": "3.11.x",
#   "calculation_method": "flatlib Swiss Ephemeris"
# }
```

### Step 10: Run Comprehensive Test
```powershell
# Update and run verification script
python verify_railway_deployment.py
```

## üîß Production Configuration

### Environment Variables Overview

## üß™ Testing Checklist

After deployment, verify these endpoints:

### Core Endpoints
- [ ] `GET /health` - Health check
- [ ] `GET /` - Root endpoint with API info
- [ ] `GET /status` - Detailed status

### Astrology Endpoints
- [ ] `POST /natal` - Natal chart calculation
- [ ] `POST /synastry` - Relationship compatibility
- [ ] `POST /transit` - Current planetary influences
- [ ] `POST /solar-return` - Annual birthday charts
- [ ] `POST /progression` - Personal evolution
- [ ] `POST /horary` - Question-based readings
- [ ] `POST /composite` - Relationship midpoint analysis

### Test Commands
```powershell
# Health check
$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://[railway-domain]/health" -Method GET
$response.Content | ConvertFrom-Json

# Natal chart test
$natalData = @{
    birth_date = "1990-05-15"
    birth_time = "10:30"
    latitude = 41.0082
    longitude = 28.9784
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://[railway-domain]/natal" -Method POST -Body $natalData -ContentType "application/json"
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### 1. Build Fails
```bash
# Check build logs
railway logs

# Common fixes:
# - Verify requirements.txt is complete
# - Check Python version compatibility
# - Ensure all dependencies are available
```

#### 2. Port Configuration Issues
```bash
# Railway provides PORT automatically
# Ensure app.py uses: port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 8080))
```

#### 3. CORS Errors
```bash
# Update CORS origins with Railway domain
railway variables set CORS_ORIGINS="https://astroyorumai.com,https://www.astroyorumai.com,https://[railway-domain]"
```

#### 4. Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Verify PostgreSQL service is added
railway services

# Check DATABASE_URL is set
railway variables
```

### Debug Commands
```powershell
# Check deployment status
railway status

# View live logs
railway logs --follow

# Access Railway shell
railway shell

# List all environment variables
railway variables

# Check service health
railway ps
```

## üîê Security Considerations

### Environment Variables Security
- [ ] SECRET_KEY is securely generated (256-bit)
- [ ] Database credentials are auto-managed by Railway
- [ ] API keys are stored as environment variables (not in code)
- [ ] CORS is configured for specific domains only

### Production Best Practices
- [ ] FLASK_DEBUG=False in production
- [ ] SSL/HTTPS enabled (automatic with Railway)
- [ ] Health checks configured
- [ ] Logging enabled for monitoring
- [ ] Error tracking configured

## üìä Monitoring & Maintenance

### Railway Dashboard Features
1. **Deployment History**: Track all deployments
2. **Resource Usage**: Monitor CPU, memory, network
3. **Logs**: Real-time application logs
4. **Metrics**: Request volume, response times
5. **Alerts**: Set up alerts for issues

### Health Monitoring
```powershell
# Create monitoring script
$healthCheck = {
    $url = "https://[railway-domain]/health"
    try {
        $response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -TimeoutSec 10
        $data = $response.Content | ConvertFrom-Json
        Write-Host "‚úÖ API Health: $($data.status) - Version: $($data.version)"
    } catch {
        Write-Host "‚ùå API Health Check Failed: $($_.Exception.Message)"
    }
}
```

## üéØ Success Criteria

Deployment is successful when:
- [ ] Railway project created and deployed
- [ ] All environment variables configured
- [ ] Health endpoint returns 200 OK
- [ ] All 9 API endpoints are functional
- [ ] CORS allows Flutter app access
- [ ] Database connection established
- [ ] Keep-alive system working
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard accessible
